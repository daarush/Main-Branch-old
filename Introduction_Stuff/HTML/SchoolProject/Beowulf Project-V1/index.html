                All of these poems (such as Beowulf) come from the period of Anglo-Saxons. The Anglo-Saxons came to England
                around 400 A.D. As the Roman Britiania was breaking up, the Germanic-speaking tribes began to inhibit the island.
                The main Germanic-speaking tribes were the Angles, Saxons, and the Jutes.

                Beowulf is an Old English epic poem consisting of 3,182 alliterative lines. It is considered as
                one of the most important works of Anglo-Saxon literature.
                <br><br>

                <h2>Plot:  </h2>
                King Hrothgar rules a successful and prosperous kingdom. He builds a mead-hall called Heorot 
                to celebrate and have a wonderful time. This angers a demon, Grendel, who lives in a swamp; 
                so he terrorizes the Danes every night for twelve years. Eventually, a young hero named 
                Beowulf comes to help the Danes and is eager  to fight the demon. Since Hrothgar did a favor 
                to Beowulf's father, therefore, accepts Beowulf. The Geatish warriors are invited to the Feast 
                since Hrothgar accepts Beowulf to help the Danes. During the feast, a jealous Dane - Unferth - 
                taunts Beowulf. When Grendel arrives, Beowulf proves to be stronger than Grendel and rips his 
                arm; Grendel wounded runs away and dies in the swamp. The arm is hung to symbolize  victory. 
                <br><br>
                Little do the Danes and the successful Geatish warriors know, a new threat arrives - Grendel's 
                mother. Grendel’s mother kills Aeschere and in return Beowulf sets out to kill Grendel’s mother. 
                When Grenel’s mother and Beowulf meet, they fight underwater; they are equal until Beowulf sees 
                a sword and swings it. Grendel's mother is killed and Beowulf decapitates the head of Grendel and
                brings it back to the Danes to celebrate. 
                <br><br>
                Beowulf succeeds the throne of Geats after Hygelac’s son dies. He ruled wisely for 50 years; 
                unfortunately a thief disturbs the dragon by taking the treasure he was guarding. The dragon 
                lays destruction and Beowulf (with a bad of courageous warriors) fights the dragon, which is 
                the last part of the poem. With help of Wiglaf, Beowulf kills the dragon but he also gets bitten 
                by the dragon. Beowulf dies due to the poison (when the dragon bit him). Beowulf wished that his 
                body should be buried with the treasure; according to the wish he is buried with the treasure.

                    Literally means “body price”; the amount of compensation paid for an offense to the 
                    injured party or, in case of death, to his family. This can be a loop until someone pays 
                    the price. We see this in Beowulf because Grendel started killing humans and did not pay 
                    for the body price; then we see Beowulf killing Grendel and not paying the price for 
                    Grendel’s mother; finally we Grenel’s mother kills Aeschere and in return Beowulf kills 
                    Grendel’s mother. This is a loop because the family of Grendel and Horthgar are fighting; 
                    nobody paid the price.

                    Means fate; Beowulf knew that he was going to be killed by the dragon, in the final part 
                    of the poem, and yet he still battled.
